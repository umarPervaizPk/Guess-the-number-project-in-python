The provided code represents a Python program that implements a simple number guessing game. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. The program runs in an infinite loop (`while True`), which allows the user to play the game multiple times without restarting the program.

2. It imports the `random` module to generate random numbers.

3. The user is prompted to input two values: a lower limit and an upper limit. These limits define the range within which the random number will be generated. The `int` function is used to ensure that the user's inputs are interpreted as integers.

4. A random number is generated within the specified range using `random.randint(lower_limit, upper_limit)` and stored in the `random_number` variable. The user is informed about the range of numbers they need to guess between the upper and lower limits.

5. The program initializes a variable `chances` to keep track of the number of attempts the user has made.

6. A nested `while` loop runs, allowing the user up to 8 chances to guess the correct number. Within this loop:
   - The user is prompted to enter their guess, which is stored in the `guess` variable.
   - The program checks if the user's guess matches the randomly generated number. If it does, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the loop is terminated using the `break` statement.
   - If the guess is smaller than the random number, the program informs the user that they guessed a smaller number.
   - If the guess is larger than the random number, the program informs the user that they guessed a larger number.
   - If the user has used all 8 chances without guessing correctly, they are informed that they have run out of chances, and the correct number is revealed. The loop is terminated.

7. After the inner loop ends (either due to a correct guess or running out of chances), the program provides a newline for separation and then breaks out of the outer loop, giving the user the option to play the game again or exit the program.

Overall, this code creates an interactive number guessing game where the user can repeatedly attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, with a limit of 8 chances to get it right before the game ends.
